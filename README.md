# Project Wheelspace

Project Wheelspace code submission for Google DSC Solution Challenge 2020

The code was programmed and ran inside Raspberry Pis using NodeRed, so version control was not being used. The sub-directories in this repository houses the flows and code which are run inside the Raspberry Pis, while the NodeRed flows can also be found there.

## Trains

These are the Raspberry Pis intended to be placed inside train cabins, and are linked to an LED indicator light to indicate when a wheelchair bound commuter is waiting to board the train at the next station.

## Stations

These are the Raspberry Pis placed at the station doors for wheelchair-bound commuters to press a button (simulated with a microbit chip) to indicate that they intend to board the next train.
